## Setup
* You should [register a new application on Imgur's API](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient) to upload stuff. All you need is the generated "Client ID" to upload. This is called in the environment variable `IMGUR_APP_ID`.
* You should also have ImageMagick configured for PHP, but [maybe Composer will help ya out](https://getcomposer.org/).
